# QEats

**QEATS** is a food ordering app where users can view the list of restaurants within 3km - 5km radius.
- Restaurants can be searched based on restaurant names, attributes or the food items they serve and increased the
search speed by 50% using multi-threading.
- Used REDIS to cache lists of nearby restaurants and reduce the response time by 95%.
- Tested the application response time to simulate user requests when under load using JMETER.
- Technologies Used: Spring Boot, Spring Data and MongoDB in the backend, Junit and Mockito for unit and integration
testing.
